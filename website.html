  <h1>About Us Page</h1>
  <p>The trio of developers known as the "Three Developers" refers to a hypothetical scenario often used in discussions or educational contexts to illustrate collaborative development practices. This scenario typically involves three distinct roles or personas working together on a software development project. Each developer represents a specific skill set and contributes differently to the project's success. Here's a brief overview of the three developers:</p>
  <p> <h3 style="background-color: darkred;">1. Front-end Developer:</h3> The front-end developer focuses on the user-facing aspects of the project. They are responsible for creating the interface that users interact with, including web pages, forms, and interactive elements. Front-end developers primarily work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and implement the visual and interactive elements of the application. They ensure that the user experience is intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing.<br><br>

<h3 style="background-color:darkred;">2. Back-end Developer:</h3> The back-end developer is concerned with the server-side logic and functionality of the application. They work on the server, databases, and application logic that power the functionality of the software. Back-end developers handle tasks such as data storage, retrieval, authentication, and business logic implementation. They use programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby, or Node.js, along with frameworks like Django, Flask, Spring, or Express.js, to build robust and scalable back-end systems.<br><br>

<h3 style="background-color:darkred">3. Full-stack Developer: </h3>The full-stack developer possesses a combination of skills in both front-end and back-end development. They are capable of working on all layers of the application stack, from the user interface to the server-side logic and database interactions. Full-stack developers have a broad understanding of web development technologies and frameworks, allowing them to take on various tasks throughout the development process. They are often involved in designing architecture, implementing features, and optimizing performance across the entire application.</p>
